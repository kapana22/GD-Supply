      {
        "q": "How long does waterproofing last?",
        "a": "Depending on the system — from 10 to 25 years. Bituminous membrane serves 10–15 years, TPO/PVC systems — 20–25 years. We provide a 10+ year workmanship warranty."
      },
      {
        "q": "What is the project timeline?",
        "a": "It depends on area and complexity. 100–300 m²: 3–5 working days. 500–1000 m²: 1–2 weeks. Commercial sites — individually."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can you work in winter?",
        "a": "Yes. We use systems adapted for all seasons. Some work types need temperatures above +5°C — in that case we select another material."

        "q": "Do you work outside Tbilisi?",
        "a": "Yes, across Georgia. Logistics are discussed based on the location."
      },
      {
        "q": "What is the difference between bitumen and TPO?",
        "a": "Bituminous membrane offers a good price/quality ratio and is a classic solution. TPO is longer-lasting, eco-friendly, and UV-resistant. Our specialist will choose the optimal system for your site."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is a permit required for the work?",
