Waterproofing has evolved from simple natural materials to modern membrane and liquid systems.

## How it started

Historically bitumen, clay and natural resins were used. The modern industry replaced them with standardised and certified systems.

## Modern approaches

Today the most common directions are:

1. **Bituminous membranes** — balanced choice of price and quality.
2. **TPO/PVC systems** — strong UV resistance and long life cycle.
3. **Liquid systems** — effective for complex details and junctions.

## Which option is right

Choose the system based on building type, use, climate and budget. There is no universal answer in practice.

## Core principle

Material matters, but correct system design and quality installation matter more.
