Selecting the right waterproofing system determines the life cycle of the project and future costs.

## Membrane systems

Classic approach widely used on flat roofs:

- Bituminous membrane
- PVC membrane
- TPO membrane

## Liquid systems

Effective on complex details where a continuous, elastic layer is required.

## Comparison

| Type | Advantage | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Membrane | Stable and predictable | Large areas |
| Liquid | Better adaptation on details | Complex junctions |

## The right decision

Final choice should follow a technical inspection of the site. Always assess the building before the project starts.
