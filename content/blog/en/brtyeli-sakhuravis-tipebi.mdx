A flat roof is often the most important structural part of both commercial and private buildings.

## Main types

### 1) Non-trafficable roof

Used when no daily movement is planned on the surface. Focus is on protection and access for maintenance.

### 2) Trafficable roof (terrace)

Designed for people, furniture or additional functional zones, so the system must handle higher loads.

### 3) Inverted system

Thermal insulation sits above the waterproofing, protecting the membrane from UV and mechanical impact.

## Making the right choice

Choose according to the mode of use, budget and technical requirements of the project.
