A flat roof looks simple, but it is a system where every detail affects the result.

## 1) Wrong slope

A flat roof should never be perfectly horizontal. A minimal slope prevents water from ponding.

- Calculated slope reduces standing water
- Drainage points must match real loads

## 2) Poor surface preparation

If the substrate is not prepared properly, adhesion of the membrane or liquid system drops and leaks appear much sooner.

## 3) Ignoring details

Corners, parapets, pipe penetrations and joints are the weakest spots. Most problems start there.

## 4) Wrong material choice

One system does not fit every site. Consider usage type, exposure, climate and budget before selecting materials.

## 5) Skipping quality control

After installation, testing and final inspection are mandatory. Without QA/QC the result is often unstable.

> Correct design + correct material + correct installation = long-term performance.
