Polyurethane systems are widely used on flat roofs, terraces and complex details where elasticity and a continuous waterproof layer are needed.

## Key advantages

- Creates a seamless waterproof layer
- Works well on complex geometry
- High elasticity during temperature changes
- Easy to rehabilitate if required

## Where it is used

Effective for both new builds and renovations: terraces, parapets, junctions and penetrations.

## What the result depends on

Final quality depends on surface preparation, primer selection, correct layer thickness and weather conditions during application.

## Conclusion

Polyurethane is a premium choice when you need strong protection, flexibility and a clean visual finish.
